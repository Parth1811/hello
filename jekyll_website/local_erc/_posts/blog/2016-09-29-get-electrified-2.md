Greetings from Electronics Club IIT Bombay

We conduct Electrified sessions regularly wherein some basic electronics
concepts are discussed and some cool DIY projects based on the concepts
discussed are made.

On 23rd september, 2016 we conducted Electrified 2 where we discussed
Operational amplifiers, transistors, sensors, and some awesome circuits
using these devices.

An overview of the content we covered.

### Operational Amplifiers

Op-amp, as often called, is an extremely versatile devices which is fundamentally a
voltage amplifying device. Using opamps we can amplify, filter and do a
lot more with signals. Also in addition to that we can perform
mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction , integration and
differentiation etc.

For more details of Opamps you can refer our
[*tutorial*]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/basic_electronics/)
on basic electronics.

### Bipolar Junction Transistors

Transistors are three terminal active devices made from different
semiconductor materials that can act as either an insulator or a
conductor by the application of a small signal voltage. The transistor’s
ability to change between these two states enables it to have two basic
functions: “switching” (digital electronics) or “amplification” (analog
electronics).

Enough of boring theory I guess, let’s get started with the circuits.

## Projects


### Xyloband

Have you ever seen the xylobands which we wear in concerts and they
flash light according to the music being played. You can make it on your
own with just basic knowledge of opamps !

Formally the problem statement would be make an LED blink on the beats
of music.

Now the beats of music are essentially the drum sounds which are of the
lowest frequency. So essentially we need to isolate the sound signals
produced made by a drum, amplify them and then make LED toggle on that
frequency.

Here is the circuit of xyloband:

![xyloband_circuit]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets-dir }}/xylo_band_circuit.jpg)

We start by taking the input of music via a microphone. We can model the
microphone as unipolar resistor. Therefore we have made a voltage
divider circuit in which one resistor is the microphone itself. When the
sound waves hit the microphone, the resistance of the microphone changes
according to the music.

So theoretically we have a voltage output of music but you can’t
directly apply this output to the LED. The reasons being :

1.  The voltage output is in order of about 10-20 millivolts.
2.  The output contains all the frequencies.

To amplify the signal we are using opamps.The next part of the circuit
you can see is an inverting voltage amplifier made by using an Opamp.
The gain factor of this amplifier is simply the ratio of resistances
connected which is 100/1.5 = 66.67.

Now we need only the signals corresponding to the drum frequencies. But
we have all frequencies corresponding to all the instruments. We need to
“filter” out these frequencies. Since the frequency we want is the
lowest of all we need to design a low pass filter.

Here too opamp comes to help. As you can see in the circuit we have
designed a low pass filter using opamp. The values of resistor and
capacitor is chosen such that the cutoff frequency of the filter is just
above the maximum frequency of drum beats.

Now after filtering the signal this is what we have in our hands : An
amplified output corresponding the the beats of the music. Note that
after filtering the higher frequencies have been attenuated.

Now what I want is that if I get the amplified output of drumbeats the
my LED should turn ON and if get the attenuated voltage of higher
frequencies then my LED should be OFF.

So basically we need to “compare” the signals with respect to a particular value.
So that’s what our next part of the circuit is; a comparator. The
reference voltage of comparator has been set by using a simple voltage
divider.

And we are done with our circuit and you are ready to make the LED dance
on your music beats.

### Audio Amplifier

In this circuit we play music through our cell phones via an external
speaker.

Here is the circuit diagram of the Audio Amplifier:

![audio_amplifier_circuit]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets-dir }}/audio_amplifier_circuit.jpg)

Can you see an AC source in the left part of circuit ? That’s where we
connect the audio jack output from our cell phones.

Now to drive a speaker we need sufficient voltage and current. The
current and voltage that we receive from the audio jack is not
sufficient to drive the speaker. Therefore in the above circuit we are
amplifying the signal in two stages; one is voltage amplifier and the
another one is current amplifier.

The voltage amplification is done by opamp. The current is amplified
using a differential amplifier made by an npn and a pnp transistor. The
final output is then connected to the speaker and you have the speaker
playing the music.

Let's have a look at how the things turned out to be :)
