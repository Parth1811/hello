XLR8 is the the first Technical Competition of the Academic year.  The primary task is to build a manually controlled bot capable of negotiating different kinds of obstacles in its path in stipulated amount of time. The team which completes the task in minimum amount of time wins. There are also prizes for other aspects of the competition.

<br/><font color="f44336">Don’t get intimidated by seeing these components. We’ll have sessions arranged before the competition to guide you through every step of the competition. Mentors will also be allotted to help and guide you.</font>
